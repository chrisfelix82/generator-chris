function wlCommonInit(){

	/*
	 * Application is started in offline mode as defined by a connectOnStartup property in initOptions.js file.
	 * In order to begin communicating with Worklight Server you need to either:
	 * 
	 * 1. Change connectOnStartup property in initOptions.js to true. 
	 *    This will make Worklight framework automatically attempt to connect to Worklight Server as a part of application start-up.
	 *    Keep in mind - this may increase application start-up time.
	 *    
	 * 2. Use WL.Client.connect() API once connectivity to a Worklight Server is required. 
	 *    This API needs to be called only once, before any other WL.Client methods that communicate with the Worklight Server.
	 *    Don't forget to specify and implement onSuccess and onFailure callback functions for WL.Client.connect(), e.g:
	 *    
	 *    WL.Client.connect({
	 *    		onSuccess: onConnectSuccess,
	 *    		onFailure: onConnectFailure
	 *    });
	 *
